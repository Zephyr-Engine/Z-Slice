# Z-Slice
My own fork of P-Slice with some optimizations `(literally h-slice and jse LMAO)`

If you want to test stuff on macOS, iOS, or Android, then please dm me via Discord (`prismgt.`), as I can only test on Linux and Windows.

This is the same engine used in DnB: Broken Reality. Discord for the mod and the engine is here: https://discord.gg/H6hy25E8z9
