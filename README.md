# Z-Slice
My own fork of P-Slice with some optimizations `(literally h-slice and jse LMAO)`

If you want to test stuff on Windows, macOS, or Android, then please dm me via Discord (`prismgt.`), as I can only test on Linux and iOS.

This is the same engine used in FNF Zephyr Edition. Discord for the mod and the engine is here: https://discord.gg/H6hy25E8z9
